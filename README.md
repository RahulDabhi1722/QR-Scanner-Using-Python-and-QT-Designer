# QR-Scanner-Using-Python-and-QT-Designer

Phase 1: Project Setup and GUI Design
Install necessary libraries like PyQt, OpenCV, and googletrans.
Use QT Designer to create the graphical user interface (GUI) with essential components such as:
Buttons for webcam control (Start, Stop, Decode).
A combo box to select languages (English, Hindi, Gujarati).
QTextEdits for displaying decoded and translated text.

Phase 2: QR Code Scanning Functionality
Implement QR code scanning using the webcam (with OpenCV) or by loading an image.
Add functionality to detect and decode the QR code using libraries like pyzbar or opencv-python.

Phase 3: Language Translation Integration
Integrate the googletrans library to translate the decoded QR code data.
Ensure that the text is translated based on the userâ€™s language selection in the combo box.

Phase 4: Voice Command Implementation
Add voice recognition functionality using libraries like SpeechRecognition.
Program voice commands such as "scan", "load image", and language selection commands like "select Gujarati language".

Phase 5: Final Testing and Debugging
Test each feature (QR code scanning, translation, voice commands, database) thoroughly.
Debug any issues and optimize performance.
